# DSA PROJECT IN C

## Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of common data structures and algorithms (DSA) implemented in C. It covers a wide range of essential concepts, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting and searching algorithms, and more.

## Features

- **Arrays**: Basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and manipulation of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stacks**: Stack implementations using arrays and linked lists, along with operations like push and pop.
- **Queues**: Queue implementations using arrays and linked lists, along with operations like enqueue and dequeue.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and common tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder).
- **Heaps**: Min-heaps and max-heaps, with applications such as heap sort.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of common sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, and others.
- **Search Algorithms**: Search techniques like linear search, binary search, and more.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuisSilva7/DSA-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd DSA-project
   ```

3. **Navigate to the directory you want to explore (ex: linked-lists):**

   ```bash
   cd linked-lists
   ```

4. **Run the program you want (ex: singly_linked_list.c ):**

   ```bash
   ../compile_execute.sh singly_linked_list.c
   ```
