# DSA PROJECT IN C

## Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of common data structures and algorithms (DSA) implemented in C. It covers a wide range of essential concepts, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting and searching algorithms, and more.

## Why? (Motivation / Problem to Solve)

Mastering data structures and algorithms is crucial for any software developer, as they form the foundation for solving complex problems efficiently. This project helps to understand how various data structures and algorithms work under the hood, focusing on implementing them in C, a low-level language. The goal is to solidify understanding and provide a reference for solving coding challenges and preparing for technical interviews. It serves as both a learning tool for beginners and a reference for experienced developers to refresh their knowledge and improve their problem-solving skills.

## Features

- **Arrays**: Basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and manipulation of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stacks**: Stack implementations using arrays and linked lists, along with operations like push and pop.
- **Queues**: Queue implementations using arrays and linked lists, along with operations like enqueue and dequeue.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and common tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder).
- **Heaps**: Min-heaps and max-heaps, with applications such as heap sort.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of common sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort, and others.
- **Search Algorithms**: Search techniques like linear search, binary search, and more.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and more.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuisSilva7/DSA-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd DSA-project
   ```

3. **Navigate to the directory you want to explore (ex: linked-lists):**

   ```bash
   cd linked-lists
   ```

4. **Run the program you want (ex: singly_linked_list.c ):**

   ```bash
   ../compile_execute.sh singly_linked_list.c
   ```
